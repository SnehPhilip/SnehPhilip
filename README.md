## Hi there I'm Sneh👋

### 👨‍💻 J2EE ,Python Developer | Open Source Enthusiast | Tech Content Writer

Sighted at building things out of the theory floating around ! 💡

This passionate developer journey is transitioning into the world of AI .. a journey from "building apps" to "building intelligence." 

Here is a "A trail of my progress" 

## 💡 My Philosophy 

- Trial fact:⚡  **"Benefiting from AI seems  magic ; But building it is not that magical "**

- Fun fact: ⚡ to unveil the show - **Learn - Machine - Learning**

### 🛤️ Stations on The AI Roadmap 

- Focus on the 'why' and 'how' behind the model. Learn beyond the interface.

- 🚉 **Station 1: Foundations** - :
-                                  Math Foundations :-  To understand the the rigorous engineering required to make AI reliable, ethical, and performant.
