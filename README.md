## Hi there I'm Sneh👋

### 👨‍💻 J2EE ,Python Developer | Open Source Enthusiast | Tech Blogger

I'm a **Development Enthusiast**  who loves building things out of all the theory around.

This passionate developer  journey is transitioning into the world of AI ... A journey from "building apps" to "building intelligence." !

Here is a "A trail of my progress" .

## 💡 My Philosophy 

- ⚡ Trial fact: **"Benefiting from AI seems  magic ; Building it is not that magical !! "**

- ⚡ Fun fact: to unveil the show - Learn - Machine Learning.

### 🛤️ Stations on The AI Roadmap !

- Focus on the 'why' and 'how' behind the model.Learn beyond the interface.
- To understand the data pipelines, the mathematical foundations, and the rigorous engineering required to make AI reliable, ethical, and performant.

- 🚉 **Station 1: Foundations** - Mastering Python, Data Structures, and SQL.
- 🚋 **Station 2: Data Exploration** - Diving into Pandas, NumPy, and the art of EDA.
- 🏎️ **Station 3: Machine Learning** - Training Scikit-Learn models and understanding optimization.
